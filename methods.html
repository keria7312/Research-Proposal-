    <h1>Methods and Design</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Methods:</b> 
How would you collect the data and why? Interviews and Observational data. 
      I choose to collect data using these methods because the topic of my 
      choice equine therapy is a human and animal study that requires observation 
      of the process and interviews of those involved. 
Describe the general methodology you choose for your study, to test your hypothesis(es). 
      My methodology is to start off with interviewing people who are involved with equine psychotherapy. 
      Then to conduct an observational study with local equine therapies and the sessions they hold. 
Explain why this method is the best for your purposes. This method is best for my purposes because 
      the topic of my choice is human, and animal based that requires observation of the humans and 
      animals and interviews of what is behind the sessions and observations.
Participants: Who would you test and why? Describe the sample you would test and explain why you 
      have chosen this sample. Include age, and language background and socio-economic information, 
      if relevant to the design. Are there any participants you would exclude? Why, why not? 
 There will be interviews with and EGALA horse specialist and onsite therapists of each equine 
      therapy facility. I choose to interview these people because they both work together during 
      the therapy sessions with both the horse and the adolescent. I choose to study two equine therapies 
      near Portland, Helping Hands Horse Rescue and Equine Therapy Inc. in Newberg and Forward Stride Stables in Beaverton.
      I choose not to interview the adolescents as they do suffer with anxiety, trauma and depression and so 
      putting them through the stress of an interview is not what I want to establish. 
      <br></br>
  <b>Design:</b> 
What would the stimuli look like and why? The stimuli would look like talking with the people of choice 
  at their ranches as well as the observations to make sure everyone is comfortable.
Describe what kinds of manipulations/variations you would make or test for to test your hypothesis(es).
  I would make sure to research the people I interview and modify my questions to their style, likes, 
  and position at the facility.
Describe the factors you would vary if you were presenting a person with stimulus sentences. 
  Explain how varying these factors would allow you to confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses. 
  The factors that would vary would how I talk to certain interviewees. 
  An example would be if I was speaking to and EGALA specialist 
  I would ask them more questions about the horse’s behaviors and 
  training to becoming a therapy horse. If I was talking with a therapist, 
  I would ask them more questions about the adolescents and the process of 
  emotions during the session. These factors would help me confirm or disconfirm 
  my hypothesis by asking and getting the hands-on information about equine therapy from the source.
Explain what significant differences you would need to find to confirm or disconfirm 
  your hypothesis(es). How could your hypothesis(es) be disconfirmed by your data? 
  I would need to make sure that what I find through interviews and observation are 
  benefits and improvement in emotional health from the adolescents. If those benefits 
  or improvements don’t appear then the data would be disconfirmed.
  <br></br>
  <b>Controls:</b> 
  What kinds of factors would you need to control for in your study? 
  I would need to speak with the people lined up in a timely matter as well as be 
  able to observe the session without disturbing the adolescents or horse. I would 
  have to do the study for a long period of time to establish that the adolescents 
  do in fact benefit during their time at the sessions as most sessions run for a 
  long period of time like regular human to human therapies do.
Describe what types of effects would be likely to occur which would make your results
  appear to confirm, or to disconfirm your hypothesis(es). Describe how you can by your
  design rule out or control for apparent effects. There would need evidence of the 
  adolescents benefits and improvement during their time with the equine therapy and 
  conversation with those involved would also help support the evidence as well as 
  some research-on-research articles of this topic. While observing it will be apparent 
  to be as little as involved as much as possible to not affect the adolescent’s sessions 
  sometimes the best way to get involved is to become an EGALA specialist and observe 
  from that point of view which is a definite possibility or becoming an volunteer 
  and helping with the sessions.
  <br></br>
<b>Procedure:</b> 
How are you going to present the stimuli? What is the participant in the 
experiment going to do? What is the step-by-step protocol? We will start with 
interviews, getting to know the people in charge of the sessions and making 
sure they agree to the study is key. Also having their background information 
about the study will help when doing the observational part of the study. 
Then comes the observational study, depending on how the people in charge 
want things to go there are a few ways of seeing to the observations. 
One is to become a volunteer or even EGALA specialist that way you are 
not disturbing the session and or even helping the people working in the session. 
Another way is just sitting in on sessions however the adolescents would have to 
agree to the study and could make it difficult on them being watched. 
<br></br>
<b>Analysis:</b> 
How will you analyze the results? What kind of results would confirm your hypothesis? 
What kind of results would disconfirm your hypothesis? The analyzation of the results 
will be first done with the interviews by coding and picking out the important aspects 
of each interview. For the observations with will be analyzing the notes taken during 
the observation and looking for the benefits and improvements as well as how the session
work and what each facility dose to help their clients. Benefits and improvements would 
confirm my results seeing the opposite would disconfirm hypotheses.
