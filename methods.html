    <h1>Methods and Design</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Methods:</b> 
      I choose to collect data using these methods because the topic of my 
      choice equine therapy is a human and animal study that requires observation 
      of the process and interviews of those involved. 
      My methodology is to start off with interviewing people who are involved with equine psychotherapy. 
      Then to conduct an observational study with local equine therapies and the sessions they hold. 
      This method is best for my purposes because the topic of my choice is human, and animal based 
      that requires observation of the humans and 
      animals and interviews of what is behind the sessions and observations.
 There will be interviews with and EGALA horse specialist and onsite therapists of each equine 
      therapy facility. I choose to interview these people because they both work together during 
      the therapy sessions with both the horse and the adolescent. I choose to study two equine therapies 
      near Portland, Helping Hands Horse Rescue and Equine Therapy Inc. in Newberg and Forward Stride Stables in Beaverton.
      I choose not to interview the adolescents as they do suffer with anxiety, trauma and depression and so 
      putting them through the stress of an interview is not what I want to establish.

<b>Design:</b> 
 The stimuli would look like talking with the people of choice 
  at their ranches as well as the observations to make sure everyone is comfortable.
  I would make sure to research the people I interview and modify my questions to their style, likes, 
  and position at the facility.The factors that would vary would how I talk to certain interviewees. 
  An example would be if I was speaking to and EGALA specialist I would ask them more questions 
  about the horse’s behaviors and training to becoming a therapy horse. If I was talking with a therapist, 
  I would ask them more questions about the adolescents and the process of 
  emotions during the session. These factors would help me confirm or disconfirm 
  my hypothesis by asking and getting the hands-on information about equine therapy from the source.
  I would need to make sure that what I find through interviews and observation are 
  benefits and improvement in emotional health from the adolescents. If those benefits 
  or improvements don’t appear then the data would be disconfirmed.

<h2>Controls</h2>
  <p> 
  I would need to speak with the people lined up in a timely matter as well as be 
  able to observe the session without disturbing the adolescents or horse. I would 
  have to do the study for a long period of time to establish that the adolescents 
  do in fact benefit during their time at the sessions as most sessions run for a 
  long period of time like regular human to human therapies do. There would need evidence of the 
  adolescents benefits and improvement during their time with the equine therapy and 
  conversation with those involved would also help support the evidence as well as 
  some research-on-research articles of this topic. While observing it will be apparent 
  to be as little as involved as much as possible to not affect the adolescent’s sessions 
  sometimes the best way to get involved is to become an EGALA specialist and observe 
  from that point of view which is a definite possibility or becoming an volunteer 
  and helping with the sessions.
</p>
  <br></br>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p> We will start with interviews, getting to know the people in charge of the sessions and making 
sure they agree to the study is key. Also having their background information 
about the study will help when doing the observational part of the study. 
Then comes the observational study, depending on how the people in charge 
want things to go there are a few ways of seeing to the observations. 
One is to become a volunteer or even EGALA specialist that way you are 
not disturbing the session and or even helping the people working in the session. 
Another way is just sitting in on sessions however the adolescents would have to 
agree to the study and could make it difficult on them being watched. 
</p>
<br></br>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>The analyzation of the results will be first done with the interviews by coding 
and picking out the important aspects of each interview. For the observations with
will be analyzing the notes taken during the observation and looking for the 
benefits and improvements as well as how the sessionwork and what each f
acility dose to help their clients. Benefits and improvements would confirm my 
results seeing the opposite would disconfirm hypotheses.
