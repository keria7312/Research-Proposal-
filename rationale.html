    <h1>Rationale</h1>
    <p>The main question is: What are the long-term benefits of equine psychotherapy 
      for adolescents in the Portland metro area who suffer from depression, anxiety, 
      and trauma? My sub questions: What are the benefits of equine psychotherapy? What does the EGALA 
      person and on-site therapist do? How do the onsite therapist and EGALA person 
      help the adolescent and the horse? How are people in and around Portland getting 
      this type of therapy? These questions will show what equine therapy is and how it works to the outside 
      world that knows little about it. They will give support to the main question 
      and add to the discussion of that question. They will explain how the equine therapy 
      helps adolescents. If they donâ€™t support the main hypothesis, they will still show 
      what equine therapy is and how it works. It may also show or add to other questions 
      on horse therapy or even other animal therapy styles.
