    <h1>Rationale</h1>
    <p>
      <br>The main question of this study is:</b> What are the long-term benefits of equine psychotherapy 
      for adolescents in the Portland metro area who suffer from depression, anxiety, 
      and trauma? 
  <br></br>
<b>Some sub questions for this study are:</b> What does the EAGALA mean and what dose and EAGALA 
      person do during therapy? What dose the onsite therapist do during ther therapy sessions do? 
      How do the onsite therapist and EAGALA person help the adolescent and the horse? How are people 
      in and around Portland finding and getting invloved in this type of therapy? How dose equone therpay 
      sessions work and what do they look like? Are there diffrent types of therapy styles based on diffrent needs?
     <br></br>
      These questions will show what equine therapy is and how it works to the outside world that knows little about it. 
      They will give support to the main question and add to the discussion of that question. 
      They will explain how the equine therapy helps adolescents. If they donâ€™t support the 
      main hypothesis, they will still show what equine therapy is and how it works. 
      It may also show or add to other questions on horse therapy or even other animal therapy styles.
