    <h1>Conclusions and Signifgance</h1>
    <p>My proposed research would lead to significant improvement because 
      not a lot of research has been done on equine therapy especially as 
      itâ€™s a new way of therapy in the emotional aspect. It will also be 
      very beneficial by being involved in the therapy sessions as if it 
      gives hands on experience and evidence straight from the source 
      rather than just looking at only research papers. This is important 
      because as the pandemic is coming to an end many people especially 
      young people are struggling with mental health disparities and are 
      seeking therapy and as equine therapy is growing many adolescents 
      seek horse therapy over human-to-human theory as its easier for them to express themselves.
