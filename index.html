     <img src=download.jpeg>
    <p>Previous research of equine psychotherapy or horse therapy has been focused on people with disabilities, 
       PTSD and or eating disorders, however over the years horse therapy has grown for those with depression, 
       anxiety, and anger management. This research paper advances in previous research to answer the question; 
       what are the advantages of equine psychotherapy for adolescents who struggled with, depression, anxiety, 
       and trauma in the Portland Metro area? Equine therapy in the past wasnâ€™t very common and was more for 
       people with disabilities, eating disorders, and PTSD. However, recently horse therapy has grown and is 
       now open to anyone with any problem that is seeking help. Mental health disparities such as depression, 
       anxiety, and trauma has grown more common with horse therapy. Other disparities like anger management 
       have become more common as well. </p>
