   <h1>Introduction</h1>   
     <p>Most of my childhood I was raised on a rescue ranch surrounded by horses and animals in general. Growing up 
        around horses I understood them and how much they impacted myself and my family emotionally. When we lost my father 
        I couldn't afford neither horse therapy or human therapy so my own horses were my own emotional therapy. Back then 
        horse therapy wasn't really known or studied either, and if it was it focused more on people with phyiscal disabilties.
        Nowdays I work at a equine therapy and rescue, where I get to really study and undertand horse therapy in all aspects 
        whether its emotional or phyiscal. 
        <br></br>
       Previous research of equine psychotherapy or horse therapy has been focused on people with disabilities, 
       PTSD and or eating disorders, however over the years horse therapy has grown for those with depression, 
       anxiety, and anger management. This research study advances in previous research to answer the question; 
       what are the advantages of equine psychotherapy for adolescents who struggled with, depression, anxiety, 
       and trauma in the Portland Metro area? Equine therapy in the past wasnâ€™t very common and was more for 
       people with disabilities, eating disorders, and PTSD. However, recently horse therapy has grown and is 
       now open to anyone with any problem that is seeking help. Mental health disparities such as depression, 
       anxiety, and trauma has grown more common with horse therapy. Other disparities like anger management 
       have become more common as well. </p>
