    <h1>Background and Review Literature</h1>
    <p>There are different types of ways equine psychotherapy is presented to those who need help, 
      weather its horse care, horseback riding, or just any horse activities. Most horse therapy 
      organizations use group therapy or one on one therapy with an onsite mental health therapist
      and EGALA specialist. Other scholars who have investigated equine psychotherapy have also 
      found effeteness in the therapy among adolescents. In an article titled, A Program Evaluation:
      Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy Outcomes for Children and adolescents by Carole Harvey, Holly 
      Jedlicka and Sandra Martinez, they talk about a study on the equine psychotherapy and EAGALA 
      programs are helping adolescents with mental health dipartites. The authors’ stated, “For adolescents, 
      hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and attention problems lessened, while for younger ones, aggression
      subsided, and social and study skills and emotional self-control improved. The results are promising 
      and give merit to replication” (Harvey et al., 2020).

      In another article titled, Effects of Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy on Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms 
      in Youth by Megan Kiely Muller and Leslie McCullough investigate the effects of horse therapy in 
      adolescents with post-traumatic stress. At the end of their study Muller and McCullough said, 
      “Findings suggested a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms across the 10-week intervention for 
      both the treatment and control group” (Mueller & McCullough, 2017).

      A third article titled, Equine 
      Facilitated Therapy for Complex Trauma (EFT-CT) by Tiffany M. Naste, Maggi Price, Jane Karol, Lia Martin,
      Kathryn Murphy, Jennifer Miguel, and Joseph Spinazzola also talk about equine therapy for adolescents with
      trauma and mental health disparities. In their article the authors’ stated, “Most notably, a decrease in 
      symptoms associated with trauma has been evident. Preliminary clinical quality improvement and case-level 
      outcome data support a decrease in anxiety, depression, somatic/sensory complaints, and behavioral dysregulation” (Naste et al., 2018).
      This projects question adds to the past research on equine psychotherapy and looks at today’s therapies, before and after COVID. 
      The research for this topic is also more in the Portland, Oregon area where equine therapy is less known about.
