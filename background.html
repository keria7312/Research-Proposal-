    <h1>Background and Review Literature</h1>
    <p>There are different types of ways equine psychotherapy is presented to 
      those who need help, weather its horse care, horseback riding, or just 
      any horse activities. Most horse therapy organizations use group therapy 
      or one on one therapy with an onsite mental health therapist and EGALA specialist.
      Other scholars who have investigated equine psychotherapy have also found effeteness 
      in the therapy among adolescents. In an article titled, 
      “A Program Evaluation: Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy Outcomes for Children and adolescents” 
      by Carole Harvey, Holly Jedlicka and Sandra Martinez, they talk about a study on the equine
      psychotherapy and EAGALA programs are helping adolescents with mental health dipartites. 
      The authors’ stated, “For adolescents, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and attention 
      problems lessened, while for younger ones, aggression subsided, and social and study skills 
      and emotional self-control improved. The results are promising and give merit to replication” (Harvey et al., 2020). 
      This is important because these findings are supporting and examining benefits of equine therapy 
      with adolescents over time.

      In another article titled, “Effects of Equine-Facilitated Psychotherapy on Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Youth”
      by Megan Kiely Muller and Leslie McCullough investigate the effects of horse therapy in adolescents with 
      post-traumatic stress. At the end of their study Muller and McCullough said, 
      “Findings suggested a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms across the 10-week intervention 
      for both the treatment and control group” (Mueller & McCullough, 2017).

     A third article titled, “Equine Facilitated Therapy for Complex Trauma (EFT-CT)” 
      by Tiffany M. Naste, Maggi Price, Jane Karol, Lia Martin, Kathryn Murphy, Jennifer Miguel, and Joseph Spinazzola
      also talk about equine therapy for adolescents with trauma and mental health disparities. 
      In their article the authors’ stated, “Most notably, a decrease in symptoms associated with
      trauma has been evident. Preliminary clinical quality improvement and case-level 
      outcome data support a decrease in anxiety, depression, somatic/sensory complaints, and behavioral 
      dysregulation” (Naste et al., 2018). This study adds to the past research on equine psychotherapy 
      and looks at today’s therapies, before and after COVID. The research for this topic is also more 
      in the Portland, Oregon area where equine therapy is less known about, but is growing.
